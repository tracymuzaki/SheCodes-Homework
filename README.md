# SheCodes-Homework
#Coding is so attractive. I learned how to use emojis, CSS positioning, properties, and styles. There is a lot to mention but it was such an incredible journey through the week one workshop.
#Week two involved adding JavaScript to our work making it dynamic and interactive. Week three summed up the SheCodes Basics Workshop with a project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
